# Credit Risk Estimation Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a complete workflow for estimating credit risk parameters‚Äî**Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD)**‚Äîusing simulated financial statement data and machine learning.  

The notebook starts with financial statement outputs from a **Financial Statement Analyzer for ABC Corp**, derives key financial ratios, trains regression models on synthetic data, and finally predicts risk parameters to compute the **Expected Loss (EL)**.

## üîπ Overview

The workflow is divided into the following steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Simulation
- Simulate a dataset with financial ratios, such as:
  - **Liquidity Ratios**: Current ratio, quick ratio  
  - **Profitability Ratios**: Net profit margin, ROA, ROE  
  - **Leverage Ratios**: Debt-to-equity  
  - **Efficiency Ratios**: Asset turnover  
- Generate synthetic target variables (**PD, LGD, and EAD**) for training.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- Split the simulated dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.  
- Train **Random Forest models** for each risk parameter (**PD, LGD, and EAD**).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ ABC Corp Analysis
- Create a **feature vector** for ABC Corp using the **derived financial ratios** from its financial statements.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Risk Prediction & Expected Loss Calculation
- Predict **PD, LGD, and EAD** using the trained models.
- Compute the **Expected Loss (EL)** using the formula:

Expected Loss (EL) = PD √ó LGD √ó EAD

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization
- Plot **actual vs. predicted values** for the test set to evaluate model performance.
